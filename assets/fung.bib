abstract = {Climate change can accelerate infrastructure deterioration in coastal areas because increased temperature and humidity can promote steel corrosion. This study (1) projects corrosion rate changes for reinforced concrete and steel structures in 223 coastal counties, (2) assesses the impact of corrosion rate changes on the useful life of structures, and (3) evaluates direct economic losses due to shortened useful life of highway bridges over the period 2000-2100. The results show that the useful life of concrete structures may decrease by 1.7-2.7% under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 and decrease by 0.7-1.1% under RCP 4.5 by the end of the 21st century. The useful life of steel structures may decrease by 7.9-15.9% under RCP 8.5 and 3.3-6.7% under RCP 4.5. Concrete bridges may suffer an average loss of $6.5-11.7/m2 under RCP 8.5 and $3.3-16.5/m2 under RCP 4.5 due to shortened useful life. Steel bridges may suffer an average loss of $73.4-111.3/m2 under RCP 8.5 and $46.9-81.2/m2 under RCP 4.5. In both climate scenarios, 10% of counties may have negative losses and 10% of counties may have losses greater than $20 million due to corrosion rate changes for concrete and steel bridges. The results reveal the spatial difference of climate change impacts on infrastructural deterioration and suggest the importance of developing regional specific adaptation strategies.}

                  with respect to quantifying the total cost to
                  retrofit an existing building. In particular, we
                  combine quantitative, qualitative, and heuristic
                  data to provide a taxonomy for understanding the
                  direct and indirect costs associated with seismic
                  risk mitigation. Much of the literature to date has
                  focused on estimating structural retrofit costs, the
                  costs of retrofitting the structural elements of a
                  building. In contrast, there is very little research
                  or data on the remaining cost components of the
                  total cost. We propose using structural cost as the
                  foundation for approximating the remaining cost
                  components and the total cost itself. To validate
                  our findings, we compare the proposed approximations
                  with actual cost estimates developed by engineering
                  professionals. }

  abstract={High-level economic estimates of disaster events typically
                  report upon direct losses and do not capture
                  indirect and longer-term impacts. In turn, these
                  indirect and longer-term losses map to
                  vulnerabilities that limit the decision sets
                  available to agents seeking to manage current and
                  future disruptive events, especially when these
                  events are complex in nature. Herein we introduce
                  the importance of considering agents' learning,
                  agency, and flexibility (LAF) when providing support
                  (financial and in-kind) aimed to enable agents to
                  increase resilience capacity. Examples are drawn
                  from a national survey conducted by agencies in the
                  U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) to better
                  understand decision-making of owners and managers of
                  micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs)
                  faced with natural disasters and other concerns in
                  the context of COVID-19. Little has been written
                  from a behavioral economics perspective about MSMEs
                  even though impacts on MSMEs have important
                  implications given their critical role in the
                  economy. Initial findings from this survey support
                  the claim that LAF are key attributes of resilience
                  capacity, especially relevant when considering
                  complex events.},

  abstract={Cedar Rapids, IA, offers a unique case study in planning
                  for increased resilience. In 2008, Cedar Rapids
                  experienced severe flooding. Rather than simply
                  rebuilding, the city of Cedar Rapids began to invest
                  in a resilient flood control system and in the
                  revitalization of its Downtown neighborhood. This
                  paper develops a Computable General Equilibrium
                  (CGE) model for the regional economy of Cedar Rapids
                  to quantify ‘resilience dividends’: net co-benefits
                  of investing in increased resilience. A resilience
                  dividend includes benefits to the community even if
                  another disaster does not occur. We build a CGE
                  model of Cedar Rapids at two different time
                  periods: one in 2007, before the flooding, and one
                  in 2015, after the flooding and initial investment
                  in resilience. We show that a positive economic
                  shock to the economy results in larger co-benefits
                  for key economic indicators in 2015 than in
                  2007. Our approach illustrates how co-benefits are
                  distributed throughout the economy. },

  abstract = { This article presents a methodology for estimating
                  seismic retrofit costs from historical data. In
                  particular, historical retrofit-cost data from
                  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 156 is
                  used to build a generalized linear model (GLM) to
                  predict retrofit costs as a function of building
                  characteristics. While not as accurate as an
                  engineering professional’s estimate, this
                  methodology is easy to apply to generate quick
                  estimates and is especially useful for decision
                  makers with large building portfolios. Moreover, the
                  predictive modeling approach provides a measure of
                  uncertainty in terms of prediction error. The
                  article uses prediction error to compare different
                  modeling choices, including the choice of
                  distribution for costs. Finally, the proposed
                  retrofit-cost model is implemented to estimate the
                  cost to retrofit a portfolio of federal
                  buildings. The application illustrates how the
                  choice of distribution affects cost estimates.},
