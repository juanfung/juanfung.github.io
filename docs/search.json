    "text": "I am an economist at the U.S. Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). My research is focused on topics in disaster resilience, including the use of predictive models to estimate seismic retrofit costs for buildings and quantifying a community’s non-disaster benefits from investing in increased resilience.\nI received a PhD in economics, as well as an MS in statistics, from University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign."
