I am an economist at the U.S. Department of Commerce [National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/people/juan-fung). My
research is focused on topics in disaster resilience, including the use of
predictive models to estimate seismic retrofit costs for buildings and
quantifying a communityâ€™s non-disaster benefits from investing in increased
resilience.

I received a PhD in economics, as well as an MS in statistics, from University
of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.
