I am an applied economist working on selected topics in disaster resilience,
including the use of predictive models to estimate seismic retrofit costs for
buildings and quantifying a communityâ€™s non-disaster benefits from investing in
increased resilience.

I received a PhD in economics, as well as an MS in statistics, from University
of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.
